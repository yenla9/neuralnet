### Contain a tool (venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb) that analyzes whether an applicant will become a successful business. It builds a neural network model using binary cross entropy and data set from Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm.

With Original Model and 50 epochs, the loss rate is 0.5535597801208496, Accuracy: 0.7331778407096863.
